    <p>Two weeks, Oct 2022</p>

    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>bibôba, a student-led bubble tea business at Bard College, needs to have a platform for structured personal and events pre-ordering. I am the co-founder of the business and I feel the need to build a more intutive ordering process. </p>

   <h2>Problem</h2>
   <p>Through user research, I discovered the problems of low discoverability, inconsistency, and inefficiency. There isn't a centeralized place for users to manage their orders with biboba. Students and student club-heads who want to order bubble tea have to go through the hassle of texting the business instagram and then waiting for the business response. The business, at the same time, have to answer the same content over and over for customers. Business wants to expand its pre-order system to more local people without having to rent and build a shop. </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>1. Develop a simple platform for ordering, specific menu, sweetness, toppings, cost, date and place for delivery with clear instruction on how to fulfilled the payment.<br>
    2. A central place for customers to keep track and manage their orders.<br>
    3. Increase customer retention and engagement.</p>



<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>My co-founder and I talked to some existing customers and ask them what logistic problem makes them less likely to order and how we can reduce the friction for them.</p>


<h2>Painpoints</h2>
<p>
  1. Individual customer: have to keep and eye on Instagram to know when the preorder will be opened or when there will be free boba at on-campus events.  <br>
  2. Individual customer: have to fill out the form and wait for the confirmation. For preorder, I also have to remind myself to go pick up. <br>
  3. Club heads/Wholesale customers: have to contact the biboba and wait for the instruction. <br>
  4. The business: have to manually reply and answer the same information over and over again. There is also no structure way to track order.</p>
<h2>Oppportunities</h2>
<p>Prioritize to improve student customers’ experience rather the business or local people.</p>

<h2>Brainstorm/Determine design goals</h2>
<h3>1. Platform: Web app: </h3>
<p>
  <b>Accessibility</b> — Web apps are accessed through a browser, so they can serve users on a wide range of devices across all operating systems.<br>
  <b>Ease of Maintenance and Customization</b> — Updates are simple and can be pushed quickly to a server for instant visibility as changes are made to a common code base.<br>
</p>
<h3>2. Design goals: </h3>
<p>
  Quick ordering form + step by step instruction on how to order and pay + reminder through email/phone number pick up date and time
  Conversation-like flow to be more user friendly
  Quick browse of date and time of on-campus with free boba
  Strong branding on every page
</p>

<h2>User flow</h2>
<p>I looked at some other restaurants pre-order app to find inspirations. What I tookaway were <br>
  1. Be succint and quickly get to the ordering section<br>
  2. No account as people just want to order food<br>
  3. The web-app is meant for everyone to use. Hence, keep the flow simple and easy to follow. <br> 
  <br>
  I also consult with my co-founder to pinpoint the bottleneck of our business ordering flow and prioritize features.

<h2 id="usertesting">User Testing</h2>
<p>On Figma, I created a <b>click-through prototype</b> to conduct usability testing to gain a thorough knowledge of how people respond to the web-app UI
  During <b>four days</b>, I conducted <b>ten tests</b> with <b>current clients and my co-founder</b>.
  I observed individuals complete the tasks via screen sharing on Zoom and offline tests.
  At the end, I received positive and surprise responses, as well as suggestions for improvement, which I later <b>incorporated into the final design</b>.
  I had a great time chatting with users, showing them the new web-app, and seeing their reactions. It inspires me to make deliberate design decisions that benefit my users.</p>


<h2 id="nextsteps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>1. Code and launch the webapp <br>
   2. Improve responsiveness on computer <br>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>I'm delighted to be working on a project for my own company from the ground up. Many thanks to my co-founders and customers for their help during the process. I learnt how to collaborate with the project manager. I challenged myself to conduct extensive research, generate several iterations, present them to my co-founder, and test with users. I'm looking forward to seeing the web-app take shape through my code. If I had more time, I would continue to collect user input and enhance the present UI.</p>
